This script automatically exploits vulnerability in OpenPLC Web Server v3

You will be able to create an automatic Rever Shell with the server without having to use manual techniques.

CVE-2021-31630 Detail
Command Injection in Open PLC Webserver v3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "Hardware Layer Code Box" component on the "/hardware" page of the application.

*The script was customized so that after completing the script registration in OpenPLC, it generates the machine's shell in the same terminal.*

Use the command below (We recommend creating a Python virtual environment to install as dependencies) # However, the breakerplc.py script must be executed outside the virtual environment.
```
sudo apt update
pip3 install requests

```
